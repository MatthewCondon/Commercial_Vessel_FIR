**Hardware**
In order to conduct any analysis on the NMEA 2000 Network, it is necessary to configure a Raspberry Pi with NMEA Hat.

When conducting our analysis of the NMEA 2000 Vessel Simulator, we used the following hardware:

It is also important to have the proper cable for connection to the NMEA 2000 Network backbone. The Hat connects to this using a NMEA 2000 CAN-Bus cable. There is no need to use a USB-C power cable for the Raspberry Pi, as NMEA cables have dedicated one of the prongs to supply power to any attached unit.
